Since it is always hard to obtain the suitable dataset to train the model, researchers tend to find the method to create the own dataset. However, there exists two principle problems: Data Labeling and Creating Data. I will focus on reading the paper related with the data labeling and creating data this month and reviewing deep learning knowledge.
