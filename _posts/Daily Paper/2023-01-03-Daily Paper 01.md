### [1230_Rethinking Person Re-Identification via Semantic-Based Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05074.pdf)

- The pretraining in the ImageNet may not the wonderful solution for the re-identification task because of the intrinsic domain gap. This paper constructed **a FineGPR-C caption dataset** to improve the semantic pretraining task for Re-ID. Besides, **VirTex Based Re-ID pretraining approach named VTBR** is proposed. This method effectively improve the performance of supervised/unsupervised pretraining on ImageNet in some images. The reason maybe the pictures have some occlusion and multiple persons in the queries. The better performance reveals that **semantic pretraining method can capture global context information and more discriminative parts.**
- FineGPR-C caption dataset is generated using dynamic caption generating strategy. The example of the dataset is shown below. What's more, **Refined Selecting (RS) stradegy** was arose to decrease the redundancy among the different attributes in FineGPR-C. (RS improves performance about 1%-5% in the comparison tests.)

### [1231_Dual encoder network with transformer-CNN for multi-organ segmentation](https://link-springer-com.lib.ezproxy.hkust.edu.hk/article/10.1007/s11517-022-02723-9)

- This paper proposes **a dual encoder network with transformer-CNN for multi-organ segmentation**. This network is the decoder-encoder U-net architecture. CNN and transformer encoder are combined to extracted the information of images. This is efficient and the fusion module can suppress the overfitting problem.
- The architecture of the method is shown below. **ResNet50** is the backbond of CNN encoder and **swin-transformer** is the backbone of transformer encoder. Spatial and channel attention are considered in the swin-transformer, so more details can be obtained in the fusion modules. Information loss problem could be alleviated. Besides, this method could be applied in other diseases. The visualization of test results on the ACDC dataset is shown below.

### [1231_Application of Convolutional Dendrite Net for Detection of Myocardial Infarction Using ECG Signals](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9954400/) 

- This paper proposes **CDD (Convolutional Dendrite Net)** which is based on the improved DD to  recognize the ECG signals. The structure of CDD is shown below. The main purpose is to improve the accuracy of Myocardial Infarction (MI) detection. Besides, Hilbert curve is used to encoder ECG signals belonging to 1-D tensor into image signals. Hilbert curve is regarded as a surjection from (0, 1) to region(0, 1) Ã— (0, 1). The ECG signal and the signal encoded by Hilbert curve is shown below.

- Dataset: PTB; Evaluation Metrics: k-fold cross validation.

- CDD can be used as a general classification module in many tasks. In the ablation experiment, the same architecture used CDD rather than CNN receives the better performance. However, Hilbert is discontinusous and the high-frequency signal could lost slightly after fixed-length sampling which affects the result little since the high-frequency signals are almost noise.

### [11_A Computational Model of Working Memory Based on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.630999/full)

- This paper proposes **a working memory model based on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity(STDP)** which adopts temporal patterns of action potentials to represent information. Therefore, this model can flexibly work in persistent and silent states. This research is useful because it provides evidence that both persistent and non-persistent mechanisms exist in the brain.

### [11_A hue preserving uniform illumination image enhancement via triangle similarity criterion in HSI color space](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00371-022-02761-2)

- This paper proposes a hue preserving uniform illumination image enhancement via **triangle similarity criterion in hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color space**. This enhancement aims at restoring the color of images under low illumination. The enhancement bases on two aspects: **intensity (I) and saturation (S)**. The reason is that the hue (H) is independent from I and S. The HSI color model is shown as below.

![HSI](/images/DailyPaper/01/8.png "HSI Color Model")

- The intensity enhancement process is shown below.  
$I_n = I_0 (1+\alpha), I_0 < 0.5; I_0 (1+0.5\alpha), I_0 \ge 0.5$

![Intensity Enhancement](/images/DailyPaper/01/9.png "Intensity Enhancement")

- The intensity enhancement process is shown below.  
$S_n = \frac{S_0I_0}{I_n}$

- Some useful evaluation metrics:  
Contrast: $C_{gain} = C_j-C_i$  
Mean contrast of an image with size M * N: $C = \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{y=1}^N \sum_{x=1}^M C(x, y)$  
Average Absolute Mean Brightness Error (AAMBE) = $\frac{1}{N}|E_0 - E_n|$  

### [11_American Sign Language Recognition for Alphabets Using Mediapipe and LSTM](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050922021378)

- MediaPipe is a useful gesture recognition model, it can be used in many application sceneries, like [the AI pose estimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06TE_U21FK4). **MediaPipe, The K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** is used to American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets recognition in Human-Computer Interface (HCI). LSTM architecture consists three steps: **the forget gate, input gate and output gate**. The structure is shown below.

### [12_Efficient convex region-based segmentation for noising and inhomogeneous patterns](https://www.aimsciences.org//article/doi/10.3934/ipi.2022074)

- The contour methods can be classified into region-based and edge-based models. The former method uses the image statistical information, the latter method uses the image gradient information. This paper proposes **the new convex region based segmentation framework**. The proposed method is to solve the problem of the use of region-based active contour method, the lack of robustness, and the inability to handle convex images at local minima.
- Average Convolution local Factor (ACF) is included to balance the intensity difference between neighboring pixels and intensity mean on the local interior and exterior regions
- This proposal method could be applied in **medical image segmentation** because the tested dataset are like the medical image dataset from my perspective.

### [12_One-step and Two-step Classification for Abusive Language Detection on Twitter](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-3006)

- This paper proposed an automatic abusive language detection method based on Twitter. **HybridCNN with Two-step classifying** is adopted to detect the various kinds of sexism and racism abusive language. The reason why selects HybridCNN is that the presentation form of abusive language could be characters, words or both. The architecture of HybridCNN is shown below.

### [12_Spectrum and Style Transformation Framework for Omni-Domain COVID-19 Diagnosis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9954228/)

- This paper proposes a plug-and-play module to improve the diagnosis performance of COVID-19 for in-domain and out-of-domain data. The data is mostly based on computed tomography (CT). The CT images collected form different devices and places are different which could affect the final diagonisis performance. The solution proposed in this paper is that **(1) A spectrum transform module is applied to remove the high-frequency information. (2) A cross-domain stylization module is used to transfer the style features to improve the generalization capability of deep neural network.** In the ablation study, the results show that the spectrum transform module improves the performance of in-domain performance and the stylization module improves the performance of out-of-domain data.
  
- In the training part, generate styled data to train the GAN and finally obtain the best hyperparameter and network. The architecture of the proposed spectrum and style transformation framework is shown below.

![Proposal Spectrum and Style Transformation Framework](/images/DailyPaper/01/13.jpeg "Proposal Spectrum and Style Transformation Framework")

- There exists data imabalence issue which contributes to the bad performance of specific domain. Besides, the branch is dependent on the domain characteristics. This could be solved by the better adaptive strategy.

### [13_Domain Generalization via Model-Agnostic Learning of Semantic Features](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/2974788b53f73e7950e8aa49f3a306db-Paper.pdf)

- The major goal of this paper is similar to the paper above: To solve the problem that test data can differ significantly in the data distribution since data is collected from different equipments and environments. This paper proposes **a model-agnostic learning paradigm**. Domain generalization is the problem that needs to be handle.

- During the training process, the domains D are randomly split into set of meta-train $D_tr$ and meta-test $D_te$ domains. In the following, minimising *Kullback-Leibler divergence* between these two domain is used to align class confusion matrix. Besides, the proposed **$L_{local}$, $L_{global}$, Contrastive Loss and Triplet Loss** are generally orthogonal to other algorithms. The generalization capability is great.


### [13_Network Binarization via Contrastive Learning](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-20083-0_35)

- This paper builds a method **Contrastive Learning for Mutual Information Maximization-Binary Neural Networks(CMIM-BNN)** which maximizes the mutual information (MI). MI is the metric that measures the information shared between binary and the FP activations. CMIN could learn representative binary activations so BNN is improved by the pull-and-pull scheme in the contrastive learning. CMIM-BNN framework is shown below. CMIM is better than several SOTA binarization methods.
