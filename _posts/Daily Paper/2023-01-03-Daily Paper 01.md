### [1230_Rethinking Person Re-Identification via Semantic-Based Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05074.pdf)

- The pretraining in the ImageNet may not the wonderful solution for the re-identification task because of the intrinsic domain gap. This paper constructed **a FineGPR-C caption dataset** to improve the semantic pretraining task for Re-ID. Besides, **VirTex Based Re-ID pretraining approach named VTBR** is proposed. This method effectively improve the performance of supervised/unsupervised pretraining on ImageNet in some images. The reason maybe the pictures have some occlusion and multiple persons in the queries. The better performance reveals that **semantic pretraining method can capture global context information and more discriminative parts.**
- FineGPR-C caption dataset is generated using dynamic caption generating strategy. The example of the dataset is shown below. What's more, **Refined Selecting (RS) stradegy** was arose to decrease the redundancy among the different attributes in FineGPR-C. (RS improves performance about 1%-5% in the comparison tests.)

- VTBR adapted ResNet-50 and semantic backbone transformer in the framework, the details of VTBR is shown below. The visualization of VTBR method and other methods are shown below. It is clearly shown that the semantic information participate the Re-ID task.

### [1231_Dual encoder network with transformer-CNN for multi-organ segmentation](https://link-springer-com.lib.ezproxy.hkust.edu.hk/article/10.1007/s11517-022-02723-9)

- This paper proposes **a dual encoder network with transformer-CNN for multi-organ segmentation**. This network is the decoder-encoder U-net architecture. CNN and transformer encoder are combined to extracted the information of images. This is efficient and the fusion module can suppress the overfitting problem.
- The architecture of the method is shown below. **ResNet50** is the backbond of CNN encoder and **swin-transformer** is the backbone of transformer encoder. Spatial and channel attention are considered in the swin-transformer, so more details can be obtained in the fusion modules. Information loss problem could be alleviated. Besides, this method could be applied in other diseases. The visualization of test results on the ACDC dataset is shown below.
