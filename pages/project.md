## **Projects**

### **Research Projects**

- **Develop An On-bike Posture Recognition Model for Road Cycling based on Computer Vision**  
**HKUST, Sept.2022 - Nov. 2022**

  1. Learned deep learning and other related knowledge from scratch.
  2. Independently investigated papers and codes to finalize the database and model used.
  3. Implemented different models to recognize cyclist posture in real-time by the depth camera and get the data of orthographic projection area.
  4. Realized the function of recognizing the athleteâ€™s posture and feedback in real time.

- **Develop Humanoid Robot Project**  
**CUHKSZ, May - July 2021**  

   1. Helped implement and adjust the parameters of the eyes applied in the humanoid robot.
   2. Be Responsible for the code development of the eyes so that they can recognize and track faces automatically.

- **Robotic Mecanum Wheel Trolley Project**  
**CUHKSZ, Jan. - May 2021**  

   1. Assembled the trolley with teammates and wrote the code to make the trolley automatically recognize the specific color blocks and grab them to a particular place.

- **Deep Learning-Based Model-Free Source Localization Project**  
**CUHKSZ, Sept. 2020 - Mar. 2021**  

  1. Integrated papers to get the Heatmap method to solve the localization problem.
  2. Generated heatmap samples to create the dataset to overcome the problem of the model-free outdoor sources.
  3. Applied the CNN model to the heatmap problem and successfully located the illegal radio stations in the urban environment with the received radio signal strength through machine learning.

### **Course Project**
- **Embedded System Development**
**HKUST, Sept. - Nov. 2022**

  1. Developed applications using Java based on Android Studio.
  2. Used Vivado to implement the required functions in FPGA.
  3. Connected and utilized IoT devices on Android OS.

- **Microprocessor Development**  
**CUHKSZ, Sept. - Dec. 2021**  

  1. Wrote codes using C in Keil to implement functions in a Cortex-M3-based microprocessor platform.

- **Electronic Circuit Design**  
**CUHKSZ, Sept. - Dec. 2021**  

  1. Used software to design circuits and implement circuit on the board to solve the certain problems.
  2. Measured and verified the results to learn the knowledge learnt from the textbook.
