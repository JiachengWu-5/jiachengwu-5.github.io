## Projects

### Research Projects

1. **Develop An On-bike Posture Recognition Model for Road Cycling based on Computer Vision
HKUST, Sept.2022 - Nov. 2022**

- Learned deep learning and other related knowledge from scratch.
- Independently investigated papers and codes to finalize the database and model used.
- Implemented different models to recognize cyclist posture in real-time by the depth camera and get the data of orthographic projection area.
- Realized the function of recognizing the athleteâ€™s gesture and feedback in real time.

2. **Develop Humanoid Robot Project
CUHKSZ, May - July 2021**

- Helped implement and adjust the parameters of the eyes applied in the humanoid robot.
- Be Responsible for the code development of the eyes so that they can recognize and track faces automatically.


3. **Robotic Mecanum Wheel Trolley Project
CUHKSZ, Jan. - May 2021**

- Assembled the trolley with teammates and wrote the code to make the trolley automatically recognize the specific color blocks and grab them to a particular place.

4. **Deep Learning-Based Model-Free Source Localization Project
CUHKSZ, Sept. 2020 - Mar. 2021**

- Integrated papers to get the Heatmap method to solve the localization problem.
- Generated heatmap samples to create the dataset to overcome the problem of the model-free outdoor sources.
- Applied the CNN model to the heatmap problem and successfully located the illegal radio stations in the urban environment with the received radio signal strength through machine learning.

### Hands-on Project

1. **Electronic Circuit Design Projects
CUHKSZ, Sept. - Dec. 2021**

- Used software to design circuits and implement circuit on the board to solve the certain problems.
- Measured and verified the results to learn the knowledge learnt from the textbook.
